          This is the website for GabyVer Shop. In this website we can see hoe the principle of repetition is used on the whole website.
          The principle of repetition simply means the reusing of the same or similar elements throughout your design.
          Repetition of certain design elements in a design will bring a clear sense of unity, consistency, and cohesiveness.

        >
        <p>
          This is the website for the New World Symphony. I think it's an
          example of Hicks's because it gives limited choices for the user to
          click on in the span of a screen. This gives the user more focus on
          what they should choose to navigate to. The user only comes across
          maybe one or two choices at a time of what to click on.

        <h4>Audition Cafe</h4>
        <a href="https://auditioncafe.com/"
          >Audition Cafe website</a
        >
        <p>
          This is the website for the online audition posting site Audition
          Cafe. It think it's a good example of white space because there is
          plenty of white space between each instrument which makes it feel
          uncluttered. The symmetry of the columns of the images of the
          instruments also leads to a balanced, asthetically pleasing design.
